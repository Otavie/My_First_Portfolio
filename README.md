## ✅ Project Structure

This project is split across two main directories:

### 📁 `html_basic/`

This folder contains several progressively built HTML pages to practice core concepts.

| File              | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base_index.html` | A minimal, valid HTML file with a basic structure.                                 |
| `index.html`      | Expanded version with paragraphs, headings, clickable image, and internal linking. |
| `tweets.html`     | Embeds a tweet and includes navigation to/from the homepage.                       |

All files follow a consistent structure with:

- `<header>` for navigation
- `<main>` containing `<article>` and `<aside>`
- `<footer>` with author attribution

Additional features:

- A **navigation bar** with links to all pages.
- A **table of learners** inside `index.html`:
  - Name, Age, and Country data.
- Placeholder content for future comment threads.

### 📁 `portfolio/`

This is your **personal portfolio website**.

| File         | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.html` | Fully semantic HTML5 portfolio with sections for Introduction, Projects, About Me, and Contact. |

Structure:

- Uses semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`
- Contains internal navigation via anchors
- Each project is displayed inside an `<article class="project">`
- Email and social links open in a new tab
